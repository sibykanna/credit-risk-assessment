# 💳 Credit Risk Assessment System

### 🧠 Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan using **machine learning**.  
It uses the [Give Me Some Credit](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit) dataset to build a predictive model that classifies borrowers as **low** or **high risk** based on financial indicators.

## 🚀 Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
- **Preprocessing & Class Balancing** using `SMOTE`
- **Baseline Logistic Regression** and **Optimized XGBoost** models
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curve
- **Explainability**: `SHAP` feature importance and XGBoost’s built-in importance
- **Interactive Streamlit Web App** for real-time prediction
- **Joblib pipeline** for model reuse and deployment
